<h1>Clients</h1>
<p>A really simple client, project and hours tracking system for people who don't want over the top applications to do it for them.</p>
<h2>Install...</h2>
<p>Fire up your web browser to the page ~/includes/install.php and follow the instructions. You should be redirected there from other pages if you aren't installed yet but to stop any errors just go there. Make sure the ~/includes/db.php file is CHMOD to 777 and then you should be ok to install.</p>
<p>If you have any issues send me an email to <b>tarnfeld@me.com</b> :)</p>
